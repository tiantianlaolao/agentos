## Copywriting & Persuasion Guide

Write compelling marketing copy that captures attention, builds desire, and drives action.

## Core Copywriting Frameworks

### AIDA (Attention - Interest - Desire - Action)

The classic framework for any marketing message:

```
ATTENTION: "Stop losing 40% of your website visitors in the first 3 seconds."

INTEREST: "Most landing pages fail because they focus on features instead
of the visitor's problem. Our research across 10,000 pages reveals the
exact pattern that keeps visitors engaged."

DESIRE: "Imagine your conversion rate doubling without spending an extra
dollar on ads. Our clients see an average 2.3x improvement within 30 days."

ACTION: "Start your free 14-day trial today. No credit card required."
```

### PAS (Problem - Agitate - Solution)

Effective for pain-point-driven copy:

```
PROBLEM: "Managing customer support tickets across multiple channels
is a nightmare."

AGITATE: "Messages get lost. Customers wait days for responses. Your team
wastes hours switching between email, chat, and social media. And every
unhappy customer tells 9 friends about their bad experience."

SOLUTION: "Unified Inbox brings all your customer conversations into one
place. One dashboard, zero missed messages, 60% faster response times."
```

### BAB (Before - After - Bridge)

Paint a transformation picture:

```
BEFORE: "You're spending 20 hours a week on manual data entry, making
mistakes, and falling behind on analysis."

AFTER: "Your reports generate automatically. Data flows in real-time.
You spend your time on strategy instead of spreadsheets."

BRIDGE: "AutoReport connects to your existing tools and automates
your entire reporting workflow in under 10 minutes."
```

### 4 U's Framework (Headlines)

Every headline should be:

1. **Useful** - What's the benefit to the reader?
2. **Urgent** - Why should they act now?
3. **Ultra-specific** - Include numbers and details
4. **Unique** - What makes this different?

```
Weak: "Improve Your Marketing"
Strong: "Get 47% More Email Opens in 7 Days with This Subject Line Formula"
```

## Writing Techniques

### Power Words

Use emotional trigger words to increase impact:

| Category | Words |
|----------|-------|
| Urgency | now, today, limited, deadline, hurry, instantly |
| Exclusivity | secret, insider, members-only, invitation, VIP |
| Trust | proven, guaranteed, certified, research-backed, trusted |
| Value | free, bonus, save, discount, exclusive, premium |
| Emotion | transform, discover, unlock, breakthrough, effortless |

### Write Like You Talk

```
BAD:  "Our innovative solution leverages cutting-edge technology
       to optimize your operational workflows."

GOOD: "We help you get more done in less time. Here's how."
```

### Use Specific Numbers

```
BAD:  "Dramatically increase your revenue."
GOOD: "Increase your revenue by 23% in 90 days."

BAD:  "Trusted by many companies."
GOOD: "Trusted by 12,000+ companies including Shopify, Stripe, and Notion."
```

### Write Short Sentences

```
BAD:  "Our platform, which was designed by experts who have years
       of experience in the industry, offers a comprehensive suite
       of tools that can help you manage your business more effectively."

GOOD: "Built by industry experts. Comprehensive tools. Better business
       management. It's that simple."
```

### Use "You" More Than "We"

```
BAD:  "We built the fastest analytics platform on the market.
       We process billions of events daily."

GOOD: "You get the fastest analytics on the market.
       Your data, processed in milliseconds."
```

## Copy Templates

### Landing Page Hero Section

```
[HEADLINE]: [Benefit-focused statement with specificity]
[SUBHEADLINE]: [How you deliver the benefit]
[SOCIAL PROOF]: [Trusted by X companies / X users / X rating]
[CTA BUTTON]: [Action-oriented verb + value]

Example:
HEADLINE: "Build Forms That Convert 3x Better"
SUBHEADLINE: "Drag-and-drop form builder with built-in A/B testing
and analytics. No coding required."
SOCIAL PROOF: "Trusted by 8,000+ marketers at companies like HubSpot and Zapier"
CTA: "Start Building for Free"
```

### Feature Description

```
[BENEFIT HEADLINE]: What does this mean for the user?
[1-2 SENTENCE DESCRIPTION]: How does it work?
[SPECIFIC EXAMPLE]: Show, don't just tell.

Example:
"Never Miss a Follow-Up Again"
Automated sequences send the right message at the right time based
on customer behavior. Set it once, and it runs on autopilot.
"When a customer abandons their cart, they'll receive a personalized
reminder within 2 hours - recovering an average of 15% of lost sales."
```

### Call-to-Action (CTA)

Strong CTAs are specific and value-oriented:

```
WEAK:     "Submit" / "Click Here" / "Learn More"
BETTER:   "Get Started Free" / "Download the Guide" / "See Pricing"
BEST:     "Start My Free Trial" / "Get My Custom Report" / "Save 3 Hours This Week"
```

### Testimonial Format

```
"[Specific result or transformation]. [Context about the challenge].
[How the product helped]. [Recommendation]."

- [Full Name], [Title] at [Company]

Example:
"We increased our email open rates from 18% to 41% in just 6 weeks.
Before, we were guessing at subject lines and send times. The AI
recommendations changed everything. If you're doing email marketing,
this is a no-brainer."

- Sarah Chen, Head of Marketing at TechCorp
```

### Email Subject Lines for Campaigns

```
Curiosity:    "The #1 mistake killing your conversion rate"
Benefit:      "Get 50% more leads with this one change"
Urgency:      "Last chance: 40% off ends at midnight"
Personal:     "[Name], your custom growth report is ready"
Social proof: "How [Company] grew revenue 300% in 6 months"
Question:     "Are you making this common pricing mistake?"
```

## Conversion Optimization Tips

### Reduce Friction

- Remove unnecessary form fields (every field reduces conversion 5-10%)
- Show security badges near payment forms
- Offer guest checkout (don't force account creation)
- Put the CTA above the fold

### Build Trust

- Show real testimonials with names and photos
- Display logos of well-known customers
- Include specific numbers and case studies
- Offer money-back guarantees
- Show ratings and review counts

### Create Urgency (Ethically)

- Limited-time offers with real deadlines
- Show stock levels when genuinely limited
- Highlight what they'll miss by waiting
- Use countdown timers for actual events

## Editing Checklist

- [ ] Does the headline pass the "So what?" test?
- [ ] Is the benefit clear within 5 seconds?
- [ ] Did you cut every unnecessary word?
- [ ] Are sentences under 20 words on average?
- [ ] Is there a clear, single CTA?
- [ ] Did you use "you/your" more than "we/our"?
- [ ] Are claims backed by specific numbers or proof?
- [ ] Would you click this / buy this / sign up for this?
