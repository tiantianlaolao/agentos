## Business Plan Guide

Create a comprehensive business plan that communicates your vision, strategy, and financial viability to investors, partners, or stakeholders.

## Business Plan Structure

### 1. Executive Summary

Write this last, but place it first. It should stand alone as a compelling overview.

```markdown
## Executive Summary

**Company:** [Name]
**Mission:** [One sentence describing what you do and for whom]
**Problem:** [The pain point you solve]
**Solution:** [Your product/service in one sentence]
**Target Market:** [Who and how large]
**Business Model:** [How you make money]
**Traction:** [Key metrics, revenue, users, partnerships]
**Team:** [Key founders and relevant experience]
**Ask:** [What you need: funding amount, partnership, etc.]

Example:
TaskFlow is a project management tool designed for remote-first teams
of 10-50 people. Remote teams waste an average of 5 hours per week
coordinating across time zones using fragmented tools. TaskFlow unifies
async communication, task management, and status updates in one platform.
We have 200 paying teams ($180K ARR) growing 15% month-over-month,
and are raising $2M to expand our sales team and launch enterprise features.
```

### 2. Problem & Opportunity

```markdown
## The Problem

Describe the problem with specificity:
- Who experiences this problem? (be specific about the persona)
- How painful is it? (quantify: time wasted, money lost, frustration)
- How are they solving it today? (current alternatives and their shortcomings)
- Why hasn't this been solved already?

## Market Opportunity

- Total Addressable Market (TAM): The entire market for your category
- Serviceable Addressable Market (SAM): The segment you can realistically reach
- Serviceable Obtainable Market (SOM): What you can capture in 3-5 years

Example:
TAM: $15B global project management software market
SAM: $3B remote-first teams segment
SOM: $150M (5% of SAM in 5 years)
```

### 3. Solution

```markdown
## Our Solution

Describe your product/service:
- What it does (features are secondary; lead with benefits)
- How it's different from alternatives
- Why now? (market timing, technology enabler, regulatory change)

## Key Features
| Feature | Benefit | Differentiation |
|---------|---------|-----------------|
| Async-first updates | No more "just checking in" meetings | Only PM tool designed for async |
| Time zone intelligence | Auto-schedules across time zones | Competitors ignore this |
| AI task prioritization | Focus on what matters most | Unique ML-based approach |
```

### 4. Business Model

```markdown
## Revenue Model

Describe how you make money:

### Pricing Tiers
| Plan | Price | Target | Features |

| Starter | $0/mo | Small teams (<5) | Core features, 1 project |
| Pro | $12/user/mo | Growing teams | Unlimited projects, integrations |
| Enterprise | Custom | Large orgs | SSO, audit logs, SLA, dedicated support |

### Unit Economics
- Average Revenue Per User (ARPU): $XX/month
- Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): $XX
- Lifetime Value (LTV): $XX
- LTV:CAC Ratio: X:1 (target >3:1)
- Gross Margin: XX%
- Payback Period: X months
```

### 5. Go-to-Market Strategy

```

### 6. Competitive Analysis

```markdown

### Direct Competitors
| Competitor | Strengths | Weaknesses | Our Advantage |
|------------|-----------|------------|---------------|
| Asana | Brand recognition, features | Complex, not async-native | Simplicity + async-first |
| Monday.com | Visual, customizable | Expensive, overwhelming | Focused on remote teams |
| Linear | Developer-friendly | Engineering-only focus | Cross-functional teams |

### Competitive Moat
What makes you defensible over time?
- Network effects: more teams → better templates → more teams

## Tips for a Strong Business Plan

1. **Lead with the problem**, not the solution
2. **Use real data** wherever possible (customer interviews, pilot results, market research)
3. **Be specific about assumptions** in financial projections
4. **Show traction**: Even small wins prove you can execute
5. **Know your numbers cold**: CAC, LTV, burn rate, runway
6. **Address risks honestly**: Investors respect self-awareness
7. **Keep it concise**: 15-20 pages maximum for written plans
