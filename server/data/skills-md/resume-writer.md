```

| Improvement | Optimized, Reduced, Increased, Streamlined, Automated |
| Analysis | Analyzed, Evaluated, Assessed, Identified, Researched |
| Achievement | Achieved, Delivered, Exceeded, Surpassed, Earned |

### 4. Skills

```

## ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Optimization

### Do

- Use standard section headings: "Experience", "Education", "Skills"
- Include keywords from the job description (exact matches)
- Use standard date formats: "Jan 2022 - Present" or "01/2022 - Present"
- Submit as PDF unless .docx is specifically requested
- Use a clean, single-column layout (no tables, text boxes, or columns)

### Don't

- Use headers/footers for important info (ATS may not read them)
- Embed text in images or graphics
- Use unusual fonts or special characters
- Rely on color alone to convey meaning
- Use abbreviations without spelling them out first

### Keyword Matching Strategy

1. Read the job description carefully
2. Identify required skills, tools, and qualifications
3. Mirror the exact terminology used (e.g., if they say "React.js" don't just write "React")
4. Include both the abbreviation and full form: "CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment)"

## Tailoring for Different Roles

### Software Engineer

Focus on: Technical depth, system design, performance metrics, code quality
```
- Designed distributed caching layer using Redis that reduced database
  queries by 80% and improved P99 latency from 2.1s to 340ms
```

### Engineering Manager

Focus on: Team growth, delivery metrics, cross-functional collaboration
```
- Grew engineering team from 4 to 12 engineers across 3 squads,
  maintaining 95% retention rate while increasing deployment
  frequency from weekly to daily
```

### Product Manager

Focus on: User impact, business metrics, stakeholder management
```
- Launched self-service onboarding flow that increased trial-to-paid
  conversion by 34% and reduced support tickets by 500/month
```

### Data Scientist

Focus on: Model performance, business impact, data scale
```
- Built churn prediction model (XGBoost) achieving 0.89 AUC,
  enabling proactive retention campaigns that saved $1.2M ARR
```

## Formatting Rules

- **Length**: 1 page for < 10 years experience, 2 pages max for senior roles
- **Font**: Clean sans-serif (Calibri, Arial, Helvetica) at 10-11pt
- **Margins**: 0.5-0.75 inches on all sides
- **Consistency**: Same date format, bullet style, and spacing throughout
- **File name**: `FirstName_LastName_Resume.pdf`

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **No metrics**: Every bullet should quantify impact when possible
2. **Job descriptions, not achievements**: Focus on what you accomplished, not what you were responsible for
3. **Irrelevant information**: Tailor content to the target role
4. **Typos and grammar errors**: Proofread multiple times; have someone else review
5. **Outdated skills**: Remove technologies you no longer use or that are obsolete
6. **Generic objective statements**: Replace with a specific professional summary
7. **Too much design**: Fancy layouts often break ATS parsing
