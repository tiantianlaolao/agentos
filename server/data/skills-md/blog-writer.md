## Blog Writing Guide

Create engaging, well-structured blog posts that attract readers and rank well in search engines.

## Blog Post Structure

### 1. Headline (Title)

The headline determines whether someone clicks. Follow these patterns:

**Proven Headline Formulas:**

- **How-to**: "How to [Achieve Result] in [Timeframe]"
- **List**: "[Number] [Adjective] Ways to [Achieve Result]"
- **Question**: "Why Does [Common Problem] Happen? (And How to Fix It)"
- **Guide**: "The Complete Guide to [Topic] for [Audience]"
- **Mistake**: "[Number] [Topic] Mistakes That [Negative Outcome]"

**Headline Checklist:**

- [ ] Contains the primary keyword
- [ ] Under 60 characters (for search results display)
- [ ] Promises a specific benefit or outcome
- [ ] Creates curiosity or urgency
- [ ] Accurate (don't clickbait)

### 2. Introduction (Hook)

You have 3 seconds to keep the reader. Use one of these hooks:

```markdown
**Start with a problem:**
"You've spent hours writing a blog post, hit publish... and crickets.
No traffic, no shares, no comments. Sound familiar?"

**Start with a surprising fact:**
"73% of blog posts get zero external links. But the top 1% generate
more traffic than the other 99% combined."

**Start with a question:**
"What if you could write one blog post that brings in 1,000 visitors
every month, on autopilot?"
```

The introduction should:
- Hook the reader in the first sentence
- Identify the problem or question
- Promise what the reader will learn
- Be 3-5 sentences maximum

### 3. Body Content

**Use the Inverted Pyramid:**
- Most important information first
- Supporting details second
- Background context last

**Formatting for Readability:**
- Short paragraphs (2-4 sentences max)
- Use subheadings (H2, H3) every 200-300 words
- Include bullet points and numbered lists
- Bold key phrases for scanners
- Add images, screenshots, or diagrams
- Use blockquotes for emphasis or citations

**Content Depth:**
- Answer the reader's question completely
- Include specific examples and data
- Link to authoritative sources
- Address common objections or follow-up questions
- Provide actionable takeaways

### 4. Conclusion

```markdown
**Summarize key points:**
"To recap, the three most important factors for [topic] are..."

**Include a call to action:**
"Now it's your turn. Pick one strategy from this list and implement it
this week. Then come back and let me know how it went in the comments."

**Suggest next steps:**
"If you found this helpful, you might also enjoy our guide on [related topic]."
```

## SEO Writing Tips

### Keyword Strategy

1. **Primary keyword**: Include in title, first paragraph, one H2, and URL
2. **Secondary keywords**: Sprinkle naturally throughout the body (2-3 times)
3. **Long-tail variations**: Use in H3 subheadings and FAQ sections
4. **Keyword density**: Aim for 1-2% (don't keyword-stuff)

### On-Page SEO Checklist

- [ ] Primary keyword in the title (preferably near the beginning)
- [ ] SEO title tag under 60 characters
- [ ] Meta description under 155 characters with keyword and CTA
- [ ] URL is short, descriptive, and contains the keyword
- [ ] Primary keyword appears in the first 100 words
- [ ] H2 and H3 tags used for content hierarchy
- [ ] Images have descriptive alt text
- [ ] Internal links to 2-3 related articles
- [ ] External links to 1-2 authoritative sources
- [ ] Content is at least 1,000 words for competitive topics

### Meta Description Template

```
[Primary keyword] - Learn [what the reader will learn] with our
[type of content]. [Benefit or outcome]. [CTA].

Example:
"React performance optimization - Learn 7 proven techniques to speed
up your React app. Reduce bundle size by 60% and improve load times.

### Engagement Boosters

- End with a specific, easy-to-complete call to action

## Content Calendar Rhythm

| Frequency | Content Type |
|-----------|-------------|
| Weekly | Short-form (800-1,200 words): tips, news, opinions |
| Bi-weekly | Medium-form (1,500-2,500 words): tutorials, comparisons |
| Monthly | Long-form (3,000+ words): ultimate guides, research pieces |

Consistency matters more than frequency. Pick a sustainable schedule and stick to it.
