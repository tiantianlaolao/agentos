## Professional Email Writing Guide

Write clear, professional emails that get results. Follow these templates and guidelines for common business communication scenarios.

## Email Structure

Every professional email should follow this structure:

1. **Subject line**: Clear, specific, and actionable
2. **Greeting**: Appropriate for your relationship
3. **Opening**: Purpose of the email in 1-2 sentences
4. **Body**: Supporting details, organized logically
5. **Call to action**: What you need from the recipient
6. **Closing**: Professional sign-off

## Subject Line Best Practices

- Be specific: "Q3 Budget Review - Approval Needed by Friday" not "Question"
- Include deadlines: "Action Required: Submit expense reports by Dec 15"
- Use prefixes for clarity: `[FYI]`, `[Action Required]`, `[Urgent]`, `[Update]`
- Keep under 60 characters for mobile readability

## Tone Guidelines

### Formal (C-suite, clients, external partners)

```
Dear Mr. Chen,

Thank you for taking the time to meet with us last Thursday. I wanted
to follow up on the points we discussed regarding the partnership.

I have attached the proposal document for your review. Please let me
know if you have any questions or would like to schedule a follow-up call.

Best regards,
[Your Name]
```

### Professional (colleagues, managers, cross-team)

```
Hi Sarah,

Quick update on the authentication feature - we've completed the backend
work and it's ready for frontend integration.

Could you let me know your team's availability this week for a handoff session?

Thanks,
[Your Name]
```

### Friendly Professional (close colleagues, team members)

```
Hey team,

Great work on the launch yesterday! Everything went smoothly and we're
seeing positive early metrics.

Let's do a quick retro tomorrow at 2pm to capture what went well and
what we can improve. I'll send a calendar invite shortly.

Cheers,

## Email Etiquette Rules

### Do

- Reply within 24 hours, even if just to acknowledge receipt
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for multiple items
- Put the most important information first
- Include all necessary context (don't assume they remember)
- Proofread before sending, especially names and attachments
- Use "Reply All" only when everyone needs the information

### Don't

- Write walls of text without formatting
- Use ALL CAPS (reads as shouting)
- Mark everything as urgent (cry wolf effect)
- CC people unnecessarily
- Send emotionally charged emails (wait 24 hours)
- Use jargon or acronyms without explanation for external recipients
- Forget the attachment (reference it and verify before sending)

## Response Time Guidelines

| Type | Expected Response |
|------|------------------|
| Urgent (production issue, client emergency) | Within 1-2 hours |
| Action required | Within 24 hours |
| FYI / informational | Within 48 hours |
| Low priority | Within 1 week |

## Length Guidelines

- **Under 5 sentences**: Quick asks, confirmations, FYIs
- **5-15 sentences**: Standard requests, updates, proposals
- **Over 15 sentences**: Consider if a meeting or document would be better
