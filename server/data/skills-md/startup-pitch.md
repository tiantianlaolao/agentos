## Startup Pitch Guide

Craft a compelling pitch deck and investor presentation that tells your story, demonstrates traction, and secures funding.

## The Pitch Deck Structure

### Slide 1: Title

```
[Company Name]
[One-line description of what you do]
[Logo]

Example:
TaskFlow
Project management built for remote-first teams.
Seed Round | January 2025
```

Keep it clean. One sentence that passes the "mom test" - could your mom understand what you do?

### Slide 2: Problem

```
Define the problem clearly and make it relatable:

1. WHO has this problem? (specific persona)
2. HOW painful is it? (quantify with data)
3. HOW are they solving it today? (status quo is your real competitor)

Example:
"Remote teams waste 5+ hours/week coordinating across time zones.
They juggle Slack, email, Notion, and Zoom to stay aligned.
67% of remote workers say tool fragmentation is their #1 frustration."

Tips:
- Use a real customer quote or story
- Show the problem with data, not just anecdotes
- Make the audience feel the pain
```

### Slide 3: Solution

```
Show your solution in action:

- Lead with the benefit, not the feature
- Include a product screenshot or demo
- Explain in one sentence how it works
- Show the "aha moment" - what makes users say "wow"

Example:
"TaskFlow replaces 4 tools with one async-first workspace.
Teams post structured updates, AI summarizes progress across
time zones, and everyone starts their day knowing exactly
what happened while they slept."
```

### Slide 4: Demo / Product

```
Options:
- Live demo (risky but impactful if it works)
- Recorded video demo (30-60 seconds)
- Product screenshots with annotations
- Interactive prototype

Rules:
- Show the actual product, not mockups
- Focus on the core value proposition (not every feature)
- Demonstrate the user journey from problem to solution
```

### Slide 5: Market Size

```
TAM → SAM → SOM funnel:

TAM: $15B - Global project management software market
SAM: $3B  - Remote-first teams (10-200 employees)
SOM: $150M - North American tech companies we can reach in 5 years

Calculation approach:
- Top-down: Industry reports, market research
- Bottom-up: # of potential customers x average revenue per customer
  Example: 500K remote teams x $300/month = $1.8B addressable

Investors want to see:
- Market is large enough to build a venture-scale business
- Clear path from SOM to SAM as you grow
- Market is growing (show CAGR)
```

### Slide 6: Business Model

```
Show how you make money:

Revenue Model:
- SaaS subscription: $12/user/month (Pro), Custom (Enterprise)
- Average contract value: $5,400/year
- Net Revenue Retention: 125%

Unit Economics:
- CAC: $180 (blended across channels)
- LTV: $2,700 (30-month avg lifetime)
- LTV:CAC = 15:1
- Payback period: 4 months
- Gross margin: 82%

If pre-revenue: show planned pricing with competitive benchmarks
```

### Slide 7: Traction

```
This is the most important slide. Show real evidence of progress.

For early-stage:
- # of users/customers and growth rate
- Revenue (MRR/ARR) and month-over-month growth
- Key engagement metrics (DAU/MAU, retention)
- Waitlist size
- Pilot customer logos and feedback quotes

For later-stage:
- Revenue trajectory graph (hockey stick preferred)
- Customer retention and expansion metrics
- Notable enterprise customers
- Key partnerships signed

Visual: Show a graph with an upward trend. Investors pattern-match
on growth curves.

Example metrics:
"$180K ARR, growing 15% month-over-month
200 paying teams across 12 countries
Net Promoter Score: 72
40% of new customers come from referrals"
```

### Slide 8: Competition

```
Show you understand the landscape without being dismissive:

Positioning matrix (2x2):

                    Async-First
                        |
          TaskFlow      |
              *         |
                        |
   Simple ──────────────┼──────────── Complex
                        |
                        |      Asana, Monday
                        |         *
                    Sync-First

Differentiation table:
| Feature | Us | Asana | Monday | Linear |
|---------|-----|-------|--------|--------|
| Async-first | Yes | No | No | Partial |
| AI summaries | Yes | No | No | No |
| Time zone intelligence | Yes | No | No | No |
| Price (per user) | $12 | $24 | $19 | $10 |

Never say: "We have no competitors."
Instead: "Here's why we win in our specific segment."
```

### Slide 9: Go-to-Market

```
Show how you'll acquire and grow customers:

Current channels (what's working):
1. Product-led growth (free tier → paid conversion: 8%)
2. Content marketing (blog drives 40% of signups)
3. Integration partnerships (Slack, GitHub app stores)

Scaling plan:
- Q1-Q2: Double down on PLG, launch referral program
- Q3-Q4: Hire first 2 sales reps for mid-market
- Year 2: Enterprise sales team, international expansion
```

### Slide 10: Team

```
Show why YOUR team will win:

- 10 years product management at Atlassian
- Led Jira's remote collaboration features
- CS degree, Stanford

[Photo] Bob Kumar, CTO
- Built real-time infra at Slack (10M+ concurrent users)
- 3x startup technical co-founder
- MS CS, MIT

Key hires planned:
- VP Sales (Q2) - Enterprise SaaS experience
- Head of Design (Q3)

Advisors:
- [Name], Former VP Engineering at [Relevant Company]
- [Name], Partner at [VC Firm]

Show: domain expertise, relevant experience, complementary skills
```

### Slide 11: Financials

```
3-year projection (keep it simple):

| Metric | 2025 | 2026 | 2027 |
|--------|------|------|------|
| ARR | $500K | $2.5M | $8M |
| Customers | 400 | 1,500 | 4,000 |
| Team Size | 8 | 20 | 40 |
| Burn Rate | $80K/mo | $150K/mo | $250K/mo |

Key assumptions (be transparent):
- 12% MoM growth in 2025, moderating to 8% by 2027
- 3% monthly churn, improving to 2%
- 60% of revenue from self-serve, 40% from sales-assisted
```

### Slide 12: The Ask

```
Raising: $3M Seed Round

Use of funds:
- 50% Engineering (hire 4 engineers, infrastructure)
- 25% Sales & Marketing (first sales hire, paid acquisition)
- 15% Operations (legal, compliance, tooling)
- 10% Buffer

Milestones this funding achieves (18-month runway):
- $2M ARR

```

## Presentation Tips

- **Specificity**: Use exact numbers, not "a lot" or "significant"
- **Honesty**: If you don't know an answer, say so. Offer to follow up.
- **Practice**: Rehearse at least 10 times before presenting to investors
